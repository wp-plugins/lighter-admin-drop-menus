* 2.5.4 fixed the awaiting comments alert and other minor glitches. Cleaned the code a good deal. Recommended.
* 2.5.3 slight redesign to favor smooth corners in the menus. 
* 2.5.2 small fixes (thanks to Robert!) and a slight redesign favoring the "tab" effect. Also FF 2 and IE 7 look more alike now.
* 2.5.1 small fixes
* 2.5 redesigned to fit into wordpress 2.5.
* 2.3 trying to fix a function that breaks translations of wordpress. We'll see.
* 2.2 actually the first version of this plugin. It should be alpha something. But because I haven't changed a line of php code in it, it is only fair that the version number should depend on the plugin I used as the base for this
